Adding References in VS Code

In Visual Studio Code, adding references for C# or .NET projects is done by modifying the project configuration rather than using a GUI like in Visual Studio. This can be achieved either through the .csproj file or by using the .NET CLI.

Using .NET CLI for NuGet Packages

Step 1: Open a terminal in your project folder. Step 2: Run the following command to add a NuGet package reference:

dotnet add package Newtonsoft.Json
Copy
This updates your .csproj file with:

<PackageReference Include="Newtonsoft.Json" Version="13.0.3" />
Copy
Step 3: Restore dependencies:

dotnet restore
Copy
This method is ideal for adding libraries available on NuGet.

Manually Adding DLL References

Step 1: Place your .dll files in a dedicated folder (e.g., dlls). Step 2: Edit your .csproj file and add:

<ItemGroup>
<Reference Include="MyLibrary">
<HintPath>dlls\MyLibrary.dll</HintPath>
</Reference>
</ItemGroup>
Copy
Step 3: Save the file and run:

dotnet build
Copy
This is useful for third-party or custom-built assemblies not available on NuGet.

Using VS Code Extensions

Install the C# extension from the VS Code Marketplace for IntelliSense and build support.

Optionally, install NuGet Package Manager to search and add packages via Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P → NuGet Package Manager: Add Package)

Verification Tip: After adding references, check Dependencies in your project tree or run:

dotnet list package
Copy
to confirm packages, or inspect .csproj for DLL references.

Best Practice: Keep third-party DLLs in a dedicated folder and avoid placing them in build output directories to maintain clean source control
