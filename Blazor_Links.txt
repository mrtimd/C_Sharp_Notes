Partial Class

Windows Forms/WPF: In Visual Studio, the UI designer generates code in one file (e.g., MyForm.Designer.cs), while the developer adds custom logic in a separate file (e.g., MyForm.cs). Both files use the partial keyword to form a single MyForm class.
LINQ to SQL / Entity Framework: ORM tools generate model classes as partial classes, allowing developers to extend them with custom validation logic or additional functionality without modifying the auto-generated file, which might be overwritten during regeneration.
Large Classes: While generally an indicator of a "god class" that might need refactoring, partial classes can be used as a stepping stone to organize an existing large class into logical sections (e.g., methods for one interface in one file, methods for another in a different file) to improve readability.

Multiple Developers: Multiple developers can work on the same class simultaneously in different files without constant merge conflicts
